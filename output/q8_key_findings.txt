KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY
===================

MODEL PERFORMANCE:
- Best performing model: Random Forest
- Random Forest achieved the highest R^2 and lowest RMSE among tested models.
- Linear Regression performed reasonably but underfit some nonlinear relationships.
- Random Forest generalizes well without major overfitting (Train R^2 ~= Test R^2 difference < 0.15).

FEATURE IMPORTANCE:
- Top predictive features: Wet Bulb Temperature, Humidity, and Solar Radiation.
- Temporal features (hour, month) contributed moderately, capturing daily and seasonal cycles.
- Wet Bulb Temperature dominated importance, reflecting its strong correlation with air temperature.

TEMPORAL PATTERNS:
- Clear seasonal trend: high air temperatures in summer (June–August), low in winter (Dec–Feb).
- Daily cycle present
- Temporal features improved model performance compared to non-temporal baselines.

DATA QUALITY:
- Dataset cleaned: missing values handled via forward-fill and median imputation.
- Outliers capped using IQR method to maintain physical realism in sensor readings.
- No major data loss after cleaning; ~195,000 rows retained.
