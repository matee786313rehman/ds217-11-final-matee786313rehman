KEY PATTERNS IDENTIFIED
======================

TEMPORAL TRENDS:
- Air Temperature shows clear annual cycles with peaks each summer (June–August) and troughs each winter (December–February)
- Overall trend is stable with no long-term warming or cooling pattern over the observed years
- Wet Bulb Temperature closely follows Air Temperature with slightly lower magnitude

SEASONAL & DAILY PATTERNS:
- Distinct seasonal variation is visible in yearly cycles
- Higher daytime temperatures observed compared to night periods (diurnal cycle)
- Maximum air temperature typically occurs around 2–3 PM; minimum around 5–6 AM

CORRELATIONS:
- Air Temperature vs Wet Bulb Temperature: 0.979 (very strong positive correlation)
- Air Temperature vs Rolling 24h Mean Air Temperature: 0.977 (very strong correlation indicating smooth temporal dependence)
- Wind Speed vs Maximum Wind Speed: 0.344 (moderate positive correlation)
- Air Temperature vs Wind Speed: -0.229 (moderate negative correlation)
- Air Temperature vs Barometric Pressure: -0.167 (weak negative correlation)
